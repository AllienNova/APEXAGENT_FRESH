# Together AI Video Integration Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the migration plan for integrating Together AI video models into Aideon AI Lite when they become available. The plan ensures a smooth transition from the current multi-provider approach to incorporating Together AI's video capabilities while maintaining system stability and user experience.

## Prerequisites

- Active monitoring of Together AI model releases through the implemented monitoring system
- Admin notification system properly configured
- Video provider interface and switching mechanism fully operational
- Together AI provider template code in place

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Detection and Validation (1-2 days)

1. **Model Detection**
   - Receive notification of new Together AI video model release
   - Manually trigger model check through admin dashboard
   - Document model capabilities, parameters, and limitations

2. **API Validation**
   - Create test account or use existing account to access new models
   - Validate API endpoints and parameters
   - Document any differences from the template implementation
   - Create sample requests and responses for reference

3. **Performance Assessment**
   - Benchmark model quality, speed, and cost
   - Compare with existing video providers (Runway ML, Replicate, Google)
   - Determine appropriate tier placement (free, premium, or both)

### Phase 2: Implementation (2-3 days)

1. **Provider Implementation**
   - Update `together_ai_provider.py` with actual API implementation
   - Implement model-specific parameters and optimizations
   - Add proper error handling and logging
   - Update model mappings with accurate capabilities

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Create comprehensive test suite for new models
   - Test with various prompts, parameters, and edge cases
   - Validate error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Ensure compatibility with existing provider switching logic

3. **Configuration Updates**
   - Update provider selector configuration
   - Add Together AI models to tier mappings
   - Configure fallback chains to include Together AI models
   - Set appropriate provider weights based on performance

### Phase 3: Deployment and Monitoring (1-2 days)

1. **Staged Deployment**
   - Deploy to development environment
   - Conduct internal testing with real users
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Conduct limited production testing with select users
   - Deploy to production with feature flag control

2. **Feature Flag Management**
   - Enable Together AI video capabilities feature flag
   - Implement gradual rollout strategy
   - Monitor usage and performance metrics
   - Adjust tier mappings and weights based on real-world performance

3. **Documentation and Training**
   - Update user documentation with new capabilities
   - Create internal knowledge base articles
   - Train support team on new features
   - Update marketing materials to highlight new capabilities

### Phase 4: Optimization and Scaling (Ongoing)

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Monitor API response times and success rates
   - Optimize request parameters for best quality/cost ratio
   - Implement caching strategies for common requests
   - Fine-tune fallback thresholds and timeout settings

2. **Cost Management**
   - Track usage costs across tiers
   - Implement cost-saving strategies for high-volume usage
   - Adjust tier limits and quotas based on actual costs
   - Optimize model selection for cost-effectiveness

3. **User Experience Refinement**
   - Collect user feedback on video quality and features
   - Implement UI improvements based on feedback
   - Add model-specific parameters to advanced settings
   - Create presets for common use cases

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues with Together AI video integration:

1. **Immediate Mitigation**
   - Disable Together AI video feature flag
   - Revert to previous provider configuration
   - Notify users of temporary service change

2. **Issue Investigation**
   - Analyze logs and error reports
   - Reproduce issues in development environment
   - Consult with Together AI support if necessary
   - Document root causes and solutions

3. **Remediation**
   - Implement fixes in development environment
   - Test thoroughly before redeployment
   - Deploy fixes with careful monitoring
   - Re-enable features gradually

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. Together AI video models are fully integrated into the provider system
2. All tiers have appropriate access to models based on quality and cost
3. Fallback mechanisms work seamlessly when needed
4. User experience is maintained or improved compared to previous providers
5. Cost efficiency is maintained or improved
6. No critical issues are reported for 7 consecutive days

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 1-2 days after model release
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 days after Phase 1 completion
- **Phase 3**: 1-2 days after Phase 2 completion
- **Phase 4**: Ongoing after initial deployment

Total time from model release to full production deployment: 4-7 days

## Responsible Teams

- **Lead Developer**: Implementation and testing
- **DevOps**: Deployment and monitoring
- **Product Manager**: Feature flag management and user communication
- **Support**: Documentation and training
- **Admin**: Cost management and optimization

## Communication Plan

1. **Internal Communication**
   - Daily status updates during implementation
   - Detailed release notes for internal teams
   - Training sessions for support and sales teams

2. **External Communication**
   - Announcement of new capabilities to users
   - Documentation updates on website
   - Blog post highlighting new features and benefits
   - Email notification to premium users

## Conclusion

This migration plan provides a structured approach to integrating Together AI video models into Aideon AI Lite when they become available. By following this plan, we can ensure a smooth transition that maintains system stability while enhancing our video generation capabilities with cutting-edge models.
