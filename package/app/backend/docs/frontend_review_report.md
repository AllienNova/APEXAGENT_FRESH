### 2.2. Together AI Integration (Phase 3 - 100.0% Complete)

- **Core Functionality**: Integration with Together AI for LLM access, secure API key management, tier-based model selection, fallback mechanisms, free tier management, UI model source indicators, usage tracking, and deployment automation.
- **Significance**: Enables access to a wide range of LLMs, offering flexibility and scalability for AI-powered features.

### 2.3. Video Provider Integration (Phase 4 - 100.0% Complete)

- **Core Functionality**: Integration with Runway ML (premium) and Replicate (free) for video generation, seamless provider switching, and preparation for Together AI video support.
- **Significance**: Provides capabilities for generating video content, expanding the application's creative potential.

### 2.4. Firebase Integration (Phase 8 - 80.0% Complete - Code Implemented, Setup Pending)

- **Core Functionality**: Code for Firestore (real-time data), Authentication, Cloud Functions, Hosting, Storage (user-generated content), Test Lab, Remote Config (feature flags), Performance Monitoring, and Crashlytics (error reporting).
- **Significance**: Offers a comprehensive suite of services for user management, real-time data, serverless functions, hosting, file storage, and critical monitoring/error reporting, once fully configured.

### 2.5. Planned Future Backend Enhancements

- **Hybrid AI System (Phase 5)**: Design for local processing, cloud fallback, intelligent task routing, offline capabilities, hybrid storage, privacy-preserving processing, and hybrid authentication/analytics.
- **LlamaCoder Integration (Phase 6)**: Proof of concept for Sandpack code sandbox, React app generation, sandbox integration into UI, code-runner adaptation, app generation as chat mode, UI enhancements, prompt optimization, analytics, and documentation.
- **Mixture of Critics (MoC) Implementation (Phase 7)**: Research and design MoC architecture for parallel LLM execution, core orchestrator, critic modules, aggregation/selection, and integration with existing LLM providers.

## 3. Frontend Enhancement Opportunities

Based on the existing backend capabilities and the overall vision for Aideon AI Lite, here are key areas for frontend enhancement:

### 3.1. User Dashboard & Analytics Visualization

- **Opportunity**: Leverage the extensive GCP analytics integration (Looker dashboards) to provide users with insightful data on their usage, model performance, and cost. This could include:
    - **Personalized Usage Metrics**: Tokens consumed, API calls, generated content count.
    - **Model Performance Insights**: Latency, success rates, and quality metrics for different LLMs.
    - **Cost Tracking**: Transparent display of credit consumption and billing information.
    - **Interactive Visualizations**: Charts and graphs for trends over time.
- **Gap**: Without a dedicated frontend for these analytics, the rich backend data remains inaccessible to end-users.

### 3.2. LLM Interaction & Management Interface

- **Opportunity**: Create a dynamic and intuitive interface for interacting with the various LLMs and managing their settings:
    - **Model Selection**: A clear UI for users to select LLMs based on tier, capability, and cost.
    - **Prompt Engineering Workspace**: An advanced editor with features like versioning, templates, and output comparison.
    - **Streaming Output**: Real-time display of LLM responses as they are generated.
    - **Fallback Indicators**: Visual cues when a fallback mechanism is engaged.
    - **API Key Management**: A secure section for users to manage their own API keys for premium LLMs.
- **Gap**: The backend supports complex LLM interactions, but the frontend needs to expose this power in a user-friendly way.

### 3.3. Video Generation Workflow

- **Opportunity**: Design a streamlined workflow for video content creation:
    - **Input Interface**: Easy upload of source media (images, audio, text).
    - **Parameter Configuration**: UI controls for video style, duration, resolution, and other generation parameters.
    - **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates on video generation status.
    - **Gallery/Management**: A section to view, download, and manage generated videos.
- **Gap**: The backend's video generation capabilities require a robust frontend to be truly usable.

### 3.4. User Authentication & Profile Management

- **Opportunity**: Build a secure and user-friendly authentication system leveraging Firebase Authentication:
    - **Login/Registration**: Standardized flows with social login options.
    - **Profile Management**: Users can update personal information, manage subscriptions (tied to LLM tiers), and view their activity history.
    - **API Key Management**: Interface for users to securely manage their own API keys.
- **Gap**: Firebase Authentication is implemented in the backend, but the frontend needs to provide the user-facing components.

### 3.5. Real-time Features & Notifications

- **Opportunity**: Utilize Firebase Firestore and Pub/Sub for real-time updates:
    - **Notifications**: In-app alerts for task completion (e.g., video generation finished, LLM response ready), system status, or billing alerts.
    - **Live Collaboration**: If applicable, real-time updates for shared projects or documents.
- **Gap**: The backend supports real-time data, but the frontend needs to consume and display these updates effectively.

### 3.6. Feature Flag Management (Admin/Developer UI)

- **Opportunity**: While primarily for internal use, a simple UI could be built to manage feature flags via Firebase Remote Config:
    - **Toggle Features**: Enable/disable features like
