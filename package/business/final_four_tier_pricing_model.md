## User-Provided API Keys Pricing

| Tier | Price | LLM Access | Credits | Concurrent Tasks |
|------|-------|------------|---------|------------------|
| **Basic** | $19.99/month | Up to 2 standard LLMs | 2,000 credits/month | Unlimited |

## User-Provided API Keys Threshold Policy

When users provide their own API keys:
- Operations using the user's own API keys do not consume credits from their allocation
- Operations using ApexAgent's API keys (for models the user doesn't have access to) consume credits from their allocation
- Once their credit allocation is depleted, users can purchase additional credits at standard rates
- Users must provide valid API keys for at least one supported LLM provider
- ApexAgent automatically switches between user-provided and ApexAgent-provided APIs based on availability and capability requirements

## API Usage Tracking System

All tiers include comprehensive API usage tracking:
- Separate tracking for user-provided vs. ApexAgent-provided API usage
- Detailed analytics on model usage and consumption rates
- Real-time credit balance monitoring
- Alerts when approaching credit thresholds
- Usage forecasting based on historical patterns
- Cost optimization recommendations
- Export capabilities for billing reconciliation
- API usage dashboards with filtering options
