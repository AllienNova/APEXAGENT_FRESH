## Design System Elements

### Typography
- Sans-serif fonts for readability
- Clear hierarchy with 3-4 text sizes
- Consistent font weights for emphasis

### Color Palette
- Primary brand color with complementary accents
- Neutral background colors (light and dark modes)
- Semantic colors for status indicators (success, warning, error)
- Accessible contrast ratios throughout

### Spacing & Layout
- Consistent spacing scale (8px increments)
- Card-based content containers
- Grid-based layouts for alignment
- Adequate whitespace for readability

### Interaction Patterns
- Consistent hover and focus states
- Loading indicators for asynchronous operations
- Animated transitions between states
- Clear feedback for all user actions

## Accessibility Considerations
- High contrast text and interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management for interactive elements
- Alternative text for visual elements

## Responsive Design
- Fluid layouts adapting to different screen sizes
- Mobile-first approach ensuring compatibility across devices
- Touch-friendly targets for mobile users
- Optimized information density for different viewport sizes

## Next Steps
These wireframes and screen designs provide the foundation for implementing the ApexAgent frontend. Upon approval, development will proceed with:

1. Implementation of core UI framework and base components
2. Development of advanced UI features and dashboards
3. Integration with backend APIs
4. Usability testing and accessibility review
5. Final delivery with comprehensive documentation
