## Implementation Recommendations

### Free Tier Configuration

For the free tier, we recommend implementing:

1. **Text**: `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo` as primary with `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1` as fallback for longer contexts
2. **Coding**: `Nexusflow/NexusRaven-V2-13B` as primary with `codellama/CodeLlama-13b-Instruct-hf` as fallback
3. **Vision**: `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-VL-7B-Chat` as the primary vision model
4. **Image Generation**: `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0` as primary
5. **Audio**: `cartesia/sonic` for TTS and `whisper-medium` for STT

### Premium Tier Fallbacks

For premium tier fallbacks (when Aideon's primary models are unavailable):

1. **Text**: `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Turbo` with `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-Turbo` for critical tasks
2. **Coding**: `deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-33b-instruct` with `codellama/CodeLlama-70b-Instruct-hf` for complex tasks
3. **Vision**: `Qwen/Qwen-VL-Chat` with `Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-instruct` as fallback
4. **Image Generation**: `stabilityai/sdxl-turbo` for quick generations and `playgroundai/playground-v2.5` for high-quality needs
5. **Audio**: `cartesia/sonic` for TTS and `whisper-large-v3` for STT

## Technical Integration Notes

1. **Context Length Management**: Implement intelligent context window management to leverage the long context capabilities of models like Mixtral-8x22B (65536 tokens)

2. **Model Routing Logic**: Develop specialized routing for coding tasks to ensure the appropriate model is selected based on the programming language and complexity

3. **Multimodal Handling**: For vision tasks, ensure proper image encoding and resolution management for optimal results with the selected models

4. **Fallback Chain**: Implement a cascading fallback chain that tries models in order of preference based on availability and performance

5. **Caching Strategy**: Develop an efficient caching strategy for commonly used prompts to reduce API calls and improve response times

## Cost Optimization

To optimize costs while maintaining quality:

1. **Intelligent Routing**: Route requests to smaller models when complexity doesn't warrant larger ones
2. **Batching**: Batch requests where possible to reduce API call overhead
3. **Caching**: Implement response caching for frequently used prompts
4. **Context Pruning**: Trim unnecessary context before sending to models to reduce token usage
5. **Quota Management**: Implement strict quota management for free tier users

## Next Steps

1. Implement the Together AI provider class following the existing provider patterns
2. Set up secure API key management for Together AI
3. Develop the tier-based model selection system
4. Implement the fallback mechanism integration
5. Create comprehensive testing suite for all selected models

This model selection strategy ensures Aideon AI Lite can offer a compelling free tier while maintaining premium quality through intelligent fallbacks, enhancing the system's capabilities without replacing its core functionality.
