# Business Model and Billing Integration Requirements for ApexAgent

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements and considerations for implementing a dual-model approach to API key management and billing in ApexAgent. The system will support both user-provided API keys and ApexAgent-provided API keys with integrated billing.

## Key Business Questions

### For the ApexAgent-provided API keys model:

1. **Usage Tiers**
   - Should we implement different tiers of usage (e.g., Basic, Pro, Enterprise)?
   - What would be the usage limits and features for each tier?
   - How would tier upgrades and downgrades be handled?

2. **Usage Tracking**
   - Should we track usage per service (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) separately or as a combined quota?
   - What metrics should be tracked (tokens, requests, compute units)?
   - How frequently should usage data be updated and reported?

3. **Billing Model**
   - Would a prepaid credit system or a pure subscription model be preferred?
   - How should overages be handled in either model?
   - Should there be rollover of unused credits/quota?

### For billing integration:

1. **Billing System**
   - Is there a preferred billing system to integrate with?
   - Should we build a custom billing system or integrate with existing solutions?
   - What payment methods should be supported?

2. **Implementation Approach**
   - Should we implement a simple usage tracking system first that could later connect to external billing?
   - What is the priority timeline for billing integration?
   - Are there regulatory or compliance requirements to consider?

## Technical Requirements

### API Key Management

1. **Dual-Model Support**
   - Store and distinguish between user-provided and ApexAgent-provided keys
   - Implement fallback mechanisms if user-provided keys fail
   - Ensure secure storage for both key types

2. **Usage Tracking**
   - Implement metering for API calls and token usage
   - Create aggregation and reporting mechanisms
   - Ensure accurate attribution of usage to specific users/accounts

3. **Quota Enforcement**
   - Implement real-time quota checking before API calls
   - Create graceful handling of quota exhaustion
   - Provide clear user notifications about quota status

### Billing Integration

1. **Data Requirements**
   - Define the data model for usage records
   - Establish secure data transfer to billing systems
   - Implement data retention policies

2. **API Integration**
   - Design interfaces for billing system communication
   - Implement authentication for billing API access
   - Create error handling and reconciliation processes

3. **User Experience**
   - Design user interfaces for quota monitoring
   - Create clear billing statements and usage reports
   - Implement account management features

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1: Core Usage Tracking**
   - Implement basic usage tracking for all API calls
   - Create storage for usage metrics
   - Develop simple reporting capabilities

2. **Phase 2: Quota Management**
   - Implement quota definition and enforcement
   - Create user notifications for quota status
   - Develop administrative tools for quota management

3. **Phase 3: Billing Integration**
   - Connect to external billing system or implement internal billing
   - Create payment processing workflows
   - Implement subscription management

4. **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
   - Implement tiered pricing models
   - Create usage optimization recommendations
   - Develop predictive usage analytics

## Next Steps

Before proceeding with implementation, we need clear answers to the business questions outlined above. These decisions will significantly impact the technical architecture and implementation approach.

In the meantime, we will proceed with the security enhancements to the ApiKeyManager as planned, ensuring that the design can accommodate both user-provided and ApexAgent-provided keys in the future.
