# Security and Compliance Requirements for Gemini Live API Integration

## Overview
This document outlines the security and compliance requirements for the Gemini Live API integration in the Aideon AI Lite platform. These requirements are designed to ensure that the integration meets enterprise security standards, regulatory requirements, and best practices for AI systems handling potentially sensitive data.

## 1. Data Security Requirements

### 1.1 Data Encryption
- **In-Transit Encryption**: All communication with Gemini Live API must use TLS 1.3 or higher

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Implement E2EE for sensitive conversations with option to enable/disable
- **Key Management**: Implement secure key rotation, storage, and recovery mechanisms

### 1.2 Data Minimization
- **Selective Transmission**: Only send necessary data to the API, filter sensitive information
- **Data Retention**: Implement configurable retention policies for conversation history
- **Data Pruning**: Automatically remove sensitive information from logs and history
- **Ephemeral Processing**: Option for no persistent storage of conversations

### 1.3 Secure Storage
- **Secure Local Storage**: Use secure storage mechanisms for local caching
- **Memory Protection**: Implement memory protection to prevent leakage of sensitive data
- **Secure Deletion**: Ensure complete removal of data when deleted
- **Storage Encryption**: Encrypt all stored files and databases

## 2. Privacy Controls

### 2.1 User Consent Management
- **Consent Framework**: Comprehensive system for obtaining and managing user consent
- **Granular Controls**: Allow users to control what data is shared and processed

### 4.3 Post-Incident Analysis
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Framework for determining incident causes
- **Lessons Learned**: Process for incorporating lessons into security
- **Remediation Tracking**: Track implementation of security improvements
- **Incident Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of incidents

## 5. Authentication and Authorization

### 5.1 Authentication
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Require MFA for sensitive operations
- **Strong Password Policies**: Enforce secure password requirements
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling and timeout
- **Identity Verification**: Verify user identity for high-risk actions

### 5.2 Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implement RBAC for all system functions
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimal necessary permissions
- **Permission Auditing**: Regular review of permissions
- **Dynamic Authorization**: Context-aware authorization decisions

## 6. Secure Development

### 6.1 Secure Coding Practices
- **Code Review**: Mandatory security code reviews
- **Static Analysis**: Automated static code analysis
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular scanning of dependencies
- **Secure Coding Standards**: Documented secure coding guidelines

### 6.2 Security Testing
