## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for predictive failure detection and self-healing capabilities for the Gemini Live API Integration with Dr. TARDIS in the Aideon AI Lite platform. This system proactively identifies potential failures before they occur and implements automated recovery mechanisms to ensure high availability and reliability.

## Core Principles

1. **Proactive Monitoring**: Detect potential failures before they impact service
2. **Automated Recovery**: Implement self-healing mechanisms to minimize human intervention
3. **Learning System**: Continuously improve detection and recovery through machine learning
