# Enterprise Features for Gemini Live API Integration with Dr. TARDIS

This directory contains the implementation of enterprise-grade features for the Gemini Live API Integration with Dr. TARDIS in the Aideon AI Lite platform.

## Overview

These enterprise features ensure that the Dr. TARDIS component meets the highest standards for enterprise deployments, including:

1. **Multi-Region Deployment**: Support for deploying across multiple geographic regions for global availability and compliance with data residency requirements.

2. **Zero-Trust Security Architecture**: Comprehensive security model that assumes no implicit trust, verifies every access request, and implements least-privilege access controls.

3. **Predictive Failure Detection with Self-Healing**: Advanced monitoring and automated recovery mechanisms to detect potential failures before they occur and implement self-healing procedures.

4. **Enterprise SLA Guarantees**: Service Level Agreement infrastructure to ensure 99.99% uptime and <2 second response times at enterprise scale.

5. **Dedicated Support Mechanisms**: Enterprise-grade support infrastructure including priority queues, escalation paths, and dedicated support channels.
