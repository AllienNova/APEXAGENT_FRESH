# Task-Aware Model Selection System

## Overview

The Task-Aware Model Selection System is an advanced component of Aideon AI Lite that automatically selects the optimal LLM for any given task or subtask without requiring explicit configuration. This system ensures that users always get the best possible results by intelligently matching tasks to the most appropriate models based on task classification, performance metrics, and contextual awareness.

## Architecture

The Task-Aware Model Selection System consists of three main components:

- **TaskAwareModelSelector**: The core component that orchestrates the selection process
- **TaskClassifier**: Analyzes and categorizes tasks into different types
- **PerformanceTracker**: Monitors and records model performance for different task types

The system follows these design principles:

- **Automatic Selection**: Always selects the best model without requiring user configuration
- **Task Analysis**: Analyzes the nature and requirements of each task
- **Performance-Based Ranking**: Maintains rankings of models based on historical performance
- **Contextual Awareness**: Considers task context when selecting models
- **Continuous Learning**: Adapts selection criteria based on outcomes

## Task Classification

The system classifies tasks into various types to ensure the most appropriate model is selected. Task types include:

- **General Conversation**: Everyday dialogue and chitchat
- **Creative Writing**: Stories, poems, creative content
- **Factual QA**: Answering factual questions
- **Summarization**: Condensing longer content
- **Translation**: Converting between languages
- **Code Generation**: Creating code from specifications
- **Code Explanation**: Explaining how code works
- **Debugging**: Finding and fixing code issues
- **Image Generation**: Creating images from descriptions
- **Image Editing**: Modifying existing images
- **Video Generation**: Creating videos from descriptions
- **Audio Generation**: Creating audio content
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzing and interpreting data
- **Reasoning**: Logical problem-solving
- **Planning**: Creating plans and strategies

The classification is performed using natural language processing techniques to analyze the task description and determine the most appropriate category.

## Performance Tracking

The system maintains a performance history for each model across different task types. This includes:

- **Success Rates**: How often the model produces satisfactory results
- **Quality Scores**: Ratings of output quality
- **Latency**: Response time measurements
- **Resource Usage**: Computational resources required
- **User Feedback**: Explicit or implicit feedback from users

This data is used to continuously refine the model rankings for each task type, ensuring that the best-performing models are prioritized.

## Contextual Model Selection

Beyond task classification, the system considers various contextual factors when selecting models:

- **Task Complexity**: Complexity level of the task
- **Content Length**: Expected length of input and output
- **Precision Requirements**: How precise the output needs to be
- **Creativity Level**: How much creativity is required
- **Time Constraints**: How quickly a response is needed

These factors are extracted from the task description and used to adjust the model selection, ensuring that the chosen model is not just good for the general task type but also for the specific context.

## Learning and Adaptation

The system continuously learns and adapts based on outcomes:

- **Outcome Recording**: Records the results of each model selection
- **Performance Updates**: Updates performance metrics based on outcomes
- **Ranking Adjustments**: Adjusts model rankings based on new data
- **Contextual Learning**: Refines understanding of which models work best in which contexts

This learning process ensures that the system becomes more accurate over time, adapting to changes in model performance and task requirements.

## Configuration

The Task-Aware Model Selection System can be configured through the Aideon AI Lite configuration system.

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "taskAwareModelSelector": {
    "performanceHistorySize": 1000,
    "historySize": 10000,
    "enableLearning": true,
    "defaultTaskType": "general_conversation",
    "contextualFactors": {
      "complexity": true,
      "length": true,
      "precision": true,
      "creativity": true,
      "timeConstraint": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```javascript
// Get the task-aware model selector
const taskAwareModelSelector = core.taskAwareModelSelector;

// Select the best model for a task
const task = {
  prompt: "Write a short story about a robot learning to paint."
};

const bestModel = taskAwareModelSelector.selectBestModel(
  'agent-1',
  'text',
  task
);

console.log(`Selected model: ${bestModel.id}`);
```

### With Context Options

```javascript
// Select the best model with context options
const task = {
  prompt: "Generate code for a binary search tree implementation."
};

const options = {
  timeConstraint: 'low', // Need a quick response
  urgent: true
};

const bestModel = taskAwareModelSelector.selectBestModel(
  'agent-1',
  'code',
  task,
  options
);

console.log(`Selected model: ${bestModel.id}`);
```

### Updating Outcome

```javascript
// Select the best model
const task = {
  prompt: "Create an image of a sunset over mountains."
};

const bestModel = taskAwareModelSelector.selectBestModel(
  'agent-1',
  'image',
  task
);

// Execute the model
const result = await modelFramework.execute(bestModel.id, 'image', task);

// Update the outcome
taskAwareModelSelector.updateSelectionOutcome(selectionId, {
  score: 85,
  metrics: {
    latency: 2500,
    userRating: 4.5
  }
});
```

## Integration with Agents

The Task-Aware Model Selection System integrates seamlessly with the multi-agent system in Aideon AI Lite:

### Agent-Specific Selection

```javascript
// Get the agent-model integration
const agentModelIntegration = core.agentModelIntegration;

// Execute model for an agent using task-aware selection
const result = await agentModelIntegration.executeModelForAgent(
  'agent-1',
  'text',
  {
    prompt: "Generate a plan for optimizing a machine learning model."
  },
  {
    useTaskAwareSelection: true // Enable task-aware selection
  }
);

console.log(result.text);
```

### Role-Based Selection

Different agent roles have different task profiles, and the Task-Aware Model Selection System takes this into account:

- **Planner Agent**: Prioritizes models with strong reasoning and planning capabilities
- **Execution Agent**: Balances performance and versatility across all modalities
- **Verification Agent**: Prioritizes models with high accuracy and reliability
- **Security Agent**: Prioritizes models with strong security awareness
- **Optimization Agent**: Prioritizes models with performance optimization capabilities
- **Learning Agent**: Prioritizes models with learning and adaptation capabilities

This role-based approach ensures that each agent has access to the models that best suit its specific responsibilities within the system.
