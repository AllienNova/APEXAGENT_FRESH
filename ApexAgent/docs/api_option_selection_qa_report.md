   - Implemented secure storage for user-provided keys

5. **Onboarding Wizard**
   - Created comprehensive first-run experience
   - Added API key entry UI for User-Provided mode
   - Implemented key testing functionality

6. **Settings UI**
   - Created API key management interface
   - Implemented mode switching with clear warnings
   - Added key management for User-Provided mode

7. **Documentation**

## Issues and Recommendations

### Minor Issues

1. **Visual Consistency**: Some UI elements in the settings page have slightly different padding than the installation wizard. Recommend standardizing padding across all UI components.

2. **Error Handling**: Add more specific error messages for different API key validation failures (e.g., distinguish between network errors and invalid key format).

3. **Documentation Screenshots**: The documentation references screenshots that need to be created once the UI is finalized.

### Recommendations for Future Enhancements

1. **API Usage Dashboard**: Add a dashboard showing API usage and costs for user-provided keys.

2. **Bulk Import/Export**: Allow users to bulk import/export API keys for easier migration.

3. **Provider-Specific Settings**: Add ability to configure provider-specific settings (e.g., OpenAI organization ID).

4. **Key Rotation Reminders**: Implement reminders for API key rotation based on best practices.

5. **Hybrid Mode**: Consider a future hybrid mode where users can use their own keys for some providers and ApexAgent keys for others.

## Conclusion

The API option selection implementation is robust, secure, and user-friendly. All components work together seamlessly to provide a cohesive experience. The code is well-structured and follows best practices for security and usability.

The implementation successfully meets the requirements of allowing users to choose between Complete System and User-Provided API Keys modes, with clear guidance throughout the process.

**Recommendation**: Approve for release after addressing the minor visual consistency issues noted above.
