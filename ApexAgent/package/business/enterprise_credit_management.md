## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive credit management system for enterprise customers of ApexAgent, providing administrators with granular control over credit usage across their organization.

## Credit Management Approaches

### 1. Administrator-Defined Quotas
- **Department Quotas**: Set credit allocations for different departments
- **Team Quotas**: Allocate credits to specific teams within departments
- **Individual Quotas**: Assign personalized credit limits to individual users
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Modify quotas in real-time based on changing priorities
- **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Default quotas can cascade from organization to department to team
- **Usage Alerts**: Configurable alerts at various thresholds (50%, 75%, 90%, etc.)

### 2. Role-Based Credit Allocation
- **Role Templates**: Predefined credit allocations based on common roles
- **Custom Role Creation**: Create organization-specific roles with tailored allocations
- **Role Examples**:
  - Developers: Higher allocations for code generation and testing
  - Data Scientists: Increased allocations for data analysis and visualization
  - Content Creators: Enhanced allocations for document creation
  - General Staff: Standard allocations for everyday assistance
- **Role Combinations**: Users can have multiple roles with combined allocations

### 3. Project-Based Budgeting
- **Project Credit Pools**: Allocate credits to specific projects rather than individuals
- **Project Timeframes**: Set credit budgets with specific timeframes
- **Cross-Charging**: Track usage for internal billing and cost allocation
- **Project Priorities**: Assign priority levels to projects for resource allocation
- **Milestone Budgeting**: Allocate credits to specific project milestones
- **Usage Reporting**: Detailed reporting on credit consumption by project

### 4. Auto-Scaling Controls
- **Threshold Policies**: Define when additional credits should be purchased
- **Approval Workflows**: Require managerial approval for exceeding certain thresholds
- **Maximum Spend Caps**: Set absolute limits on auto-purchasing
- **Graduated Pricing**: Implement volume discounts for auto-purchased credits
- **Throttling Options**: Automatically reduce service levels when approaching limits
- **Emergency Overrides**: Allow designated administrators to bypass limits

### 5. Usage Governance Policies
- **Acceptable Use Policies**: Define what types of tasks are permitted
- **Model Selection Policies**: Control which LLM models can be used for which purposes
- **Time-of-Day Restrictions**: Limit high-consumption operations to off-peak hours
- **Resource Intensive Operations**: Require approval for operations exceeding certain thresholds
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Provide AI-driven suggestions for more efficient usage
