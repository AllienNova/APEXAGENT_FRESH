## Module 5: Best Practices and Tips

### 5.1 Effective Prompting for Dr. TARDIS

#### Principles of Effective Prompting
1. **Be Specific**: Clearly state what you're looking for
2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant background information
3. **One Task at a Time**: Break complex requests into smaller steps
4. **Specify Format**: Indicate how you want the response structured
5. **Iterate**: Refine your prompts based on responses

#### Example Prompts

**Less Effective:**
```
Tell me about vector databases.
```

**More Effective:**
```
Explain the key differences between Milvus, Chroma, and FAISS vector databases in terms of performance, scalability, and use cases. Please format the response as a comparison table followed by a brief summary of when to use each option.
```

### 5.2 Optimizing Search Queries

#### Search Query Best Practices
1. **Use Natural Language**: Phrase queries as you would speak them
2. **Include Key Terms**: Incorporate important domain-specific terminology
3. **Avoid Filler Words**: Remove unnecessary words like "the," "a," "an"
4. **Consider Synonyms**: Think about alternative terms for your concepts
5. **Refine Iteratively**: Start broad and narrow down based on results

#### Search Filters
Combine vector search with metadata filters for more precise results:

```
Query: "Kubernetes deployment strategies"
Filters:
- Date: Last 6 months
- Content Type: Technical Documentation
- Tags: "Production", "High Availability"
```
