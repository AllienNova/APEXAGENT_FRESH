# ApexAgent Project Management System Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for a comprehensive project management system within ApexAgent that preserves memory across different conversations and implements automatic version control for artifacts. The system is designed to maintain context and continuity across multiple chat sessions while ensuring all outputs and artifacts are properly versioned and accessible.

## Core Components

### 1. Project Structure

Each project in ApexAgent will have the following structure:

```
Project/
├── Metadata/
│   ├── project_config.json       # Project configuration and settings
│   ├── memory_index.json         # Cross-conversation memory index
│   └── agent_activity_log.json   # Log of all agent actions
├── Conversations/
│   ├── conversation_1/
│   │   ├── chat_history.json     # Complete chat transcript
│   │   ├── memory_snapshot.json  # Memory state at end of conversation
│   │   └── context_references.json # References to relevant knowledge
│   ├── conversation_2/
│   └── ...
└── Artifacts/
    ├── code/
    │   ├── file1.py              # Latest version
    │   ├── file1.py.v1           # Version 1
    │   ├── file1.py.v2           # Version 2
    │   └── ...
    ├── documents/
    ├── images/
    └── versions/
        └── version_metadata.json # Version tracking for all artifacts
```

### 2. Project Memory System

The project memory system will maintain continuity across conversations through:

1. **Global Project Memory**: Long-term memory store that persists across all conversations within a project
2. **Conversation-Specific Memory**: Short-term memory specific to individual conversations
3. **Memory Indexing**: Cross-referencing system that links related information across conversations
4. **Memory Retrieval**: Contextual retrieval system that surfaces relevant information from previous conversations

### 3. Artifact Version Control

The artifact version control system will:

1. **Track Changes**: Automatically detect and track changes to any artifact created or modified
2. **Version History**: Maintain a complete version history with timestamps and associated conversations
3. **Diff Visualization**: Provide visual comparison between versions
4. **Rollback Capability**: Allow reverting to previous versions when needed
5. **Branch Management**: Support creating branches for experimental changes

### 4. Cross-Conversation Context

To maintain context across different conversations:

1. **Context Passing**: Essential context is passed between conversations
2. **Knowledge Graph**: Relationships between conversations, artifacts, and external references are maintained
3. **Conversation Linking**: Explicit links between related conversations
4. **Context Summarization**: Automatic summarization of previous conversations for reference

## User Interface Components

### 1. Project Navigator

A dedicated panel in the UI that displays:

- Project hierarchy and structure
- All conversations within the project
- All artifacts with version indicators
- Quick access to recent items

### 2. Artifact Gallery

A specialized view for managing artifacts:

- Grid/list view of all project artifacts
- Version history visualization
- Diff comparison tool
- Filtering by type, date, conversation
- Search functionality

### 3. Conversation History Browser

Interface for browsing past conversations:

- Chronological list of all conversations
- Search and filter capabilities
- Highlighting of conversations that produced artifacts
- Context indicators showing relationship to current conversation

### 4. Version Timeline

Visual timeline showing:

- All artifact versions across the project
- When versions were created
- Which conversation created each version
- Branching structure for complex artifacts

### 5. Memory Inspector

Developer tool for examining the project memory:

- View current memory state
- Explore memory connections
- Understand what context is being carried forward
- Manually adjust memory priorities if needed

## Implementation Details

### 1. Local Storage Architecture

All project data will be stored locally on the user's PC:

- File-based storage for artifacts with standard formats
- SQLite database for memory, metadata, and relationships
- JSON export/import capability for backup and transfer
- Configurable storage locations

### 2. Memory Management

The memory system will use:

- Embedding-based retrieval for semantic search
- Importance scoring to prioritize critical information
- Automatic pruning of less relevant information
- Manual pinning of essential context

### 3. Version Control Implementation

The version control system will:

- Use git-like mechanics for tracking changes
- Store complete versions rather than just diffs for reliability
- Maintain metadata linking versions to conversations
- Support branching and merging for complex workflows

### 4. Agent Visibility

To ensure transparency of agent actions:

- Real-time activity log in the UI
- Visual indicators of file system access
- Notifications for significant actions
- Detailed logs of all operations
- Permission management for sensitive operations

## User Workflows

### 1. Creating a New Project

1. User creates a new project and sets basic parameters
2. System initializes project structure on local storage
3. User starts first conversation
4. All artifacts created are automatically versioned and stored

### 2. Continuing Work in a New Conversation

1. User selects existing project
2. User starts a new conversation
3. System loads relevant context from project memory
4. Agent acknowledges previous work and context
5. New artifacts are versioned and linked to the new conversation

### 3. Referencing Previous Work

1. User asks about previous work in the project
2. System retrieves relevant conversations and artifacts
3. Agent provides context-aware responses with references
4. User can navigate to referenced items directly

### 4. Managing Artifact Versions

1. User views artifact version history
2. User compares different versions
3. User can revert to previous versions if needed
4. System maintains complete history regardless of reverts

## Integration with Existing ApexAgent UI

The project management system will integrate with the existing ApexAgent UI:

1. **Left Sidebar**: Add project navigation section
2. **Main Content Area**: Add tabs for project overview and artifact management
3. **Right Context Panel**: Add project memory and version history views
4. **Chat Interface**: Add indicators for project context and referenced artifacts

## Security and Privacy

1. All project data remains local to the user's PC
2. No cloud synchronization unless explicitly configured
3. Encryption options for sensitive projects
4. Granular permission controls for agent actions

## Technical Requirements

1. **Storage**: Efficient local storage with indexing
2. **Memory**: Vector database for semantic retrieval
3. **Versioning**: Git-like version control system
4. **UI**: React components for project management
5. **Backend**: Local service for memory and version management

## Next Steps

1. Develop detailed data schemas for project structure
2. Create UI mockups for project management components
3. Implement core memory persistence system
4. Develop artifact version control system
5. Integrate with existing ApexAgent UI
6. Test with complex multi-conversation workflows
