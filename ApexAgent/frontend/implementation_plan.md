# ApexAgent Frontend Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the ApexAgent frontend, merging the existing wireframes with the provided React code to create a comprehensive desktop application interface with robust system integration features.

## Implementation Approach
We will use a hybrid approach that:
1. Uses the provided React code as the foundation for implementation
2. Incorporates design elements from our existing wireframes
3. Ensures all system integration features are properly implemented

## Core UI Components

### 1. Application Layout
- **Main Layout Structure**: Three-panel layout with collapsible sidebar, main content area, and context panel
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes with collapsible panels
- **Theme Support**: Light/dark mode with consistent color scheme

### 2. Navigation System
- **Project Explorer**: Collapsible sidebar with project listing and system integration services
- **File System Navigator**: Tree view of local directories with file status indicators
- **Tab Navigation**: Multi-tab interface for different workspaces (chat, files, console, resources)

### 3. Conversation Interface
- **Message Thread**: Clear distinction between user and agent messages
- **Code Blocks**: Syntax highlighting and copy functionality
- **System Action Indicators**: Visual representation of file operations and commands
- **Multimodal Input**: Text, voice, and file attachment support

### 4. System Integration Features
- **File System Integration**: Direct access to local files with status indicators
- **Activity Monitoring**: Real-time logging of all agent actions
- **Permission Management**: Granular controls for system access
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, and disk usage visualization

### 5. Project Management
- **Project Creation/Import**: Tools for managing local projects
- **Storage Location Management**: Control over where files are stored
- **Backup Configuration**: Local backup settings and scheduling

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Framework Setup
- Set up React project with TypeScript
- Implement main layout components
- Create theme provider and design system

### Phase 2: Navigation and File System
- Implement collapsible sidebar
- Create file system navigator
- Build tab navigation system

### Phase 3: Conversation Interface
- Develop message thread component
- Implement code block rendering
- Create multimodal input area

### Phase 4: System Integration
- Build file system integration components
- Implement activity monitoring
- Create permission management interface
- Develop resource monitoring dashboard

### Phase 5: Project Management
- Implement project creation/import
- Build storage location management
- Create backup configuration interface

### Phase 6: Testing and Refinement
- Perform usability testing
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Optimize performance

## Technical Specifications

### State Management
- React hooks for component-level state
- Context API for application-wide state
- Local storage for persistence

### UI Component Library
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide icons for consistent iconography
- Custom components for specialized functionality

### System Integration
- File system access via native APIs
- Process monitoring through system interfaces
- Permission management with secure storage

## Design Principles
- **Transparency**: All agent actions are visible and logged
- **Control**: User has granular control over permissions and access
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined workflows for common tasks
- **Consistency**: Uniform design language throughout the application
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all components

## Next Steps
1. Set up the React project structure
2. Implement the core layout components
3. Develop the navigation system
4. Build the conversation interface
5. Integrate system monitoring features
