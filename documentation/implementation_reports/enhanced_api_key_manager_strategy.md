# Enhanced API Key Manager Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for enhancing the security of the ApiKeyManager component in ApexAgent. The strategy addresses the weaknesses identified in the security analysis and proposes a robust approach to encryption and key management.

## Core Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security to protect sensitive credentials
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Limiting access to only what is necessary
3. **Key Separation**: Different keys for different purposes and services
4. **Secure by Default**: Strong security without complex configuration
5. **Auditability**: Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events

## Encryption Library Selection

After evaluating several options, we recommend using a combination of libraries to provide comprehensive security:

### Primary Encryption: PyNaCl (libsodium)

**Rationale**: 
- Modern, audited cryptographic library with high-level APIs
- Provides authenticated encryption (encryption + integrity verification)
- Supports key derivation, public-key cryptography, and secure random number generation
- Actively maintained and widely used in security-critical applications

**Key Features**:
- Secret Box for symmetric encryption with authentication
- Support for key derivation functions
- Secure memory management for sensitive data

### Key Management: Python-KeyRing

**Rationale**:
- Platform-native secure credential storage
- Integrates with system keychains (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service)
- Provides a consistent API across platforms
- Allows secure storage of the master key outside of environment variables

**Key Features**:
- OS-integrated secure storage
- No need to manually handle master key storage
- Reduces risk of key exposure

### Additional Security: Cryptography.io

**Rationale**:
- Comprehensive cryptographic library with both high and low-level interfaces
- Provides additional cryptographic primitives when needed
- Compatible with existing Fernet implementation for migration purposes

## Key Hierarchy and Management

We propose implementing a hierarchical key management system:

1. **Master Key**:
   - Stored securely using the system keyring
   - Used only to encrypt/decrypt the key encryption keys
   - Rotated infrequently (e.g., annually or upon security events)

2. **Key Encryption Keys (KEKs)**:
   - Derived from the master key using a key derivation function
   - Used to encrypt/decrypt data encryption keys
   - Versioned to support key rotation
   - Stored in the encrypted configuration file

3. **Data Encryption Keys (DEKs)**:
   - Generated per service or group of related services
   - Used to encrypt/decrypt the actual credential data
   - Rotated more frequently than higher-level keys
   - Stored in the encrypted configuration file

This hierarchy allows for:
- Selective rotation of keys at different levels
- Minimizing exposure of the master key
- Compartmentalization of credential data

## Storage Architecture

The enhanced storage architecture will include:

1. **Configurable Storage Backend**:
   - File-based storage (default, backward compatible)
   - Optional database storage for enterprise deployments
   - Extensible interface for custom storage backends

2. **Structured Data Format**:
   - JSON-based format with versioning
   - Metadata section for key versions and rotation information
   - Separate sections for different credential types

3. **File Security Enhancements**:
   - Strict permission enforcement
   - Integrity verification using HMAC
   - Optional encryption of filenames

4. **Directory Structure**:
   ```
   ~/.apex_agent/
   ├── security/
   │   ├── keystore.enc       # Encrypted key store containing KEKs and DEKs
   │   └── config.json        # Security configuration (non-sensitive)
   └── credentials/
       ├── api_keys.enc       # Encrypted API keys
       └── oauth_tokens.enc   # Encrypted OAuth tokens
   ```

## Access Control and Authentication

To implement the principle of least privilege:

1. **Plugin-Level Access Control**:
   - Define access policies for which plugins can access which credentials
   - Implement a permission system similar to Android/iOS app permissions
   - Require explicit declaration of required credentials in plugin metadata

2. **Authentication for Sensitive Operations**:
   - Optional second factor for accessing highly sensitive credentials
   - Challenge-response for programmatic access to certain credentials
   - Rate limiting for credential access attempts

3. **Audit Logging**:
   - Comprehensive logging of all credential access
   - Tamper-evident logs for security events
   - Configurable log levels and destinations

## Key Rotation and Versioning

A robust key rotation strategy includes:

1. **Automatic Key Rotation**:
   - Time-based rotation schedules configurable per key level
   - Event-based rotation (e.g., after potential compromise)
   - Graceful handling of in-use credentials during rotation

2. **Key Versioning**:
   - Each key associated with a version number
   - Metadata to track which version encrypted which data
   - Support for multiple active key versions during transition periods

3. **Migration Path**:
   - Automatic re-encryption of data when keys are rotated
   - Backward compatibility with older key formats
   - Utilities for manual key rotation and emergency key recovery

## Secure Deletion and Memory Management

To prevent data leakage:

1. **Secure Memory Handling**:
   - Use of secure memory allocation when available
   - Explicit memory wiping after use
   - Minimizing time sensitive data remains in memory

2. **Secure Deletion**:
   - Overwriting of sensitive data before deletion
   - Proper handling of file system nuances
   - Verification of deletion when possible

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow these phases:

1. **Core Infrastructure**:
   - Implement the key hierarchy and storage architecture
   - Set up the basic encryption/decryption with PyNaCl
   - Establish secure key storage with keyring

2. **Migration Layer**:
   - Create compatibility layer for existing encrypted data
   - Implement automatic migration of credentials
   - Provide fallback mechanisms for backward compatibility

3. **Access Control System**:
   - Implement plugin permission system
   - Add authentication for sensitive operations
   - Set up audit logging

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - Implement key rotation and versioning
   - Add support for alternative storage backends
   - Enhance secure deletion and memory management

## Security Considerations

1. **Threat Model**:
   - Protection against unauthorized access to the local system
   - Defense against malicious plugins
   - Mitigation of memory dumping attacks
   - Resistance to offline attacks on the encrypted data

2. **Limitations**:
   - Cannot protect against compromised OS or hardware
   - Limited protection if the master password/key is compromised
   - Trade-offs between security and usability

3. **Recommendations for Deployment**:
   - Regular security audits
   - Proper user education on master key protection
   - System-level security hardening
   - Regular updates to cryptographic libraries

## Conclusion

This enhanced API Key Manager strategy provides a comprehensive approach to securing sensitive credentials in ApexAgent. By implementing multiple layers of security, a hierarchical key management system, and robust access controls, we can significantly improve the security posture of the credential storage system while maintaining usability and compatibility with existing plugins.

The strategy addresses all weaknesses identified in the security analysis and provides a clear path for implementation and migration from the current system.
