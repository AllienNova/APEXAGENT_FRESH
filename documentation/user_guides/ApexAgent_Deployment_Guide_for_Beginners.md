### Network Requirements

- Outbound connections to:
  - LLM API providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
  - GitHub (for updates)
  - npm registry (for dependencies)
  - PyPI (for Python dependencies)

## Required API Keys

ApexAgent requires API keys to access various LLM providers. Below is a comprehensive table of all potential API keys you might need:

| Provider | API Key Type | Required For | How to Obtain | Cost Structure |
|----------|--------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| OpenAI | API Key | GPT-4, GPT-3.5 models | [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/) | Pay-per-token, varies by model |
| Anthropic | API Key | Claude models | [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) | Pay-per-token, varies by model |
| Google | API Key | Gemini models | [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/) | Pay-per-token, varies by model |
| Cohere | API Key | Command models | [Cohere Dashboard](https://dashboard.cohere.com/) | Pay-per-token, varies by model |
| Azure OpenAI | API Key + Endpoint | Azure-hosted models | [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) | Pay-per-token + Azure hosting |
| AWS Bedrock | Access Key + Secret | AWS-hosted models | [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) | Pay-per-token + AWS charges |
