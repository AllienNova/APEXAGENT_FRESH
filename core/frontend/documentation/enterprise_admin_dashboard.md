- When Aideon must use its own API keys, those operations consume credits
- Once credits are depleted, users can purchase additional credits
- 10% discount on monthly charges when users provide their own API keys

### Partial API Key Management
- Granular tracking of which specific API keys each user has provided
- Mixed credit system where only operations using system API keys consume credits

- Transparent usage dashboard showing which services use user vs. system keys
- Flexible API key addition with immediate effect on credit consumption
