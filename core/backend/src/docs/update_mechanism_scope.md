   - User-configurable update check frequency
   - Non-intrusive notification system
   - Update metadata retrieval (version, release notes, requirements)

2. **Update Delivery**
   - Full package updates for major versions
   - Delta/incremental updates for minor versions and patches
   - Bandwidth-efficient update packaging
   - Support for various network conditions (including low bandwidth)

3. **Update Installation**
   - Secure verification of update packages
   - Pre-installation system compatibility checks
   - Automated and manual installation options
   - Progress reporting during installation

4. **Version Management**
   - Version history tracking
   - Update catalog maintenance
   - Dependency resolution between components
   - Plugin compatibility verification

5. **Rollback System**
   - System state preservation before updates
   - One-click rollback to previous versions
   - Partial rollbacks for specific components
   - Automatic rollback on failed updates

6. **Offline Updates**
   - Downloadable update packages for air-gapped environments
   - Package verification for offline updates
   - Batch update capability for multiple systems

7. **Update Scheduling**
   - Immediate, scheduled, or manual update options
   - Quiet hours configuration
   - Enterprise deployment scheduling integration

8. **Security Measures**
   - Update package signing and verification
   - Secure update channels (HTTPS)
   - Tamper detection for update packages
   - Protection against man-in-the-middle attacks

## Objectives

1. **Reliability**
   - Ensure 99.9% success rate for update operations
   - Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery
   - Provide detailed logging for troubleshooting
   - Ensure system stability during and after updates

2. **Security**
   - Implement cryptographic verification for all update packages
   - Ensure secure transmission of update data
   - Protect against unauthorized or malicious updates
   - Maintain integrity of the update process

3. **Efficiency**
   - Minimize bandwidth usage through delta updates
   - Optimize update package size and compression
   - Reduce system downtime during updates
   - Minimize resource usage during update operations

4. **User Experience**
   - Provide clear and informative update notifications
   - Offer flexible update scheduling options
   - Ensure minimal disruption to user workflow
   - Provide transparent progress reporting

5. **Enterprise Readiness**
   - Support centralized update management
   - Enable policy-based update deployment
   - Provide integration with enterprise management systems
   - Support compliance and audit requirements

2. Securely verifies the authenticity and integrity of all update packages
3. Efficiently manages bandwidth through delta updates where appropriate
4. Provides a seamless and non-disruptive user experience
5. Offers robust rollback capabilities in case of update issues
6. Supports both online and offline update scenarios
7. Integrates with enterprise management systems
8. Maintains detailed logs for audit and troubleshooting purposes

## Dependencies

- Installation System (Task 084) - Completed
- Error Handling Framework (Task 007) - Partially Completed
- Authentication System (Task 009) - Not Started (for secure update channels)

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Update failures leaving system in unstable state | High | Medium | Implement transaction-based updates with automatic rollback |
| Network issues during update download | Medium | High | Add resume capability and integrity checking |
| Compatibility issues with plugins | High | Medium | Implement pre-update compatibility checks |
| Security compromise of update channel | Critical | Low | Use strong cryptographic signing and verification |
| User resistance to automatic updates | Medium | Medium | Provide flexible configuration options and clear benefits |

## Timeline

Estimated implementation time: 3-4 weeks

- Phase 1: 1-1.5 weeks
- Phase 2: 1-1.5 weeks
- Phase 3: 1 week
- Testing and refinement: Throughout all phases
