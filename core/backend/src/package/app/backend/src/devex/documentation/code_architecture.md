## System Architecture

ApexAgent follows a modular, event-driven architecture designed for extensibility and maintainability. The system is organized into the following high-level layers:

### Presentation Layer
- User interfaces (Web, CLI)
- API endpoints
- Event visualization

### Application Layer
- Business logic
- Service orchestration
- Event processing
- Plugin management

### Domain Layer
- Core domain models
- Business rules
- Event definitions

### Infrastructure Layer
- Data persistence
- External integrations
- Messaging
- Logging and monitoring

## Core Components

### Event System
The event system is the backbone of ApexAgent, enabling loose coupling between components through an event-driven architecture.

**Key Classes:**
- `EventManager`: Central hub for event emission and subscription
- `EventSubscriber`: Interface for components that listen to events
- `Event`: Base class for all events in the system

**Usage Example:**
```javascript
// Subscribe to an event
eventManager.subscribe('user.created', (event) => {
  console.log(`User created: ${event.data.username}`);
}, { priority: 10 });

// Emit an event
eventManager.emit('user.created', { username: 'johndoe' });
```

### Plugin System
The plugin system allows for extending ApexAgent's functionality without modifying the core codebase.

**Key Classes:**
- `PluginManager`: Manages the lifecycle of plugins
- `PluginLoader`: Loads plugin modules dynamically
- `PluginDiscovery`: Discovers available plugins
- `PluginRegistry`: Registers and tracks loaded plugins

**Plugin Lifecycle:**
1. Discovery - Finding available plugins
2. Loading - Loading plugin code
3. Registration - Registering plugin with the system
4. Initialization - Setting up plugin resources
5. Start - Activating plugin functionality
6. Stop - Deactivating plugin functionality
7. Unload - Removing plugin from the system

### Error Handling Framework
The error handling framework provides a robust system for managing errors, recovery strategies, and telemetry.

**Key Classes:**
- `ErrorRecoveryManager`: Manages recovery strategies for different error types
- `ErrorTelemetry`: Collects and analyzes error data
- `ErrorEvents`: Defines error-related events

## Design Patterns

### Observer Pattern
Used extensively in the event system to allow components to subscribe to and react to events.

### Dependency Injection
Used to provide components with their dependencies, improving testability and flexibility.

### Factory Pattern
Used for creating complex objects, particularly in the plugin system.

### Strategy Pattern
Used in the error handling framework to select appropriate recovery strategies.

### Repository Pattern
Used for data access, abstracting the details of data storage and retrieval.

```

## Data Flow

### Request-Response Flow
1. Request arrives at API endpoint
2. Authentication/authorization middleware processes request
3. Controller handles request and invokes appropriate service
4. Service performs business logic, possibly emitting events
5. Repository layer handles data persistence
6. Response is formatted and returned

### Event Flow
1. Component emits an event via EventManager
2. EventManager notifies all subscribers in priority order
3. Subscribers process the event and may emit additional events
4. Plugins can hook into this flow at various points

## API Reference

### REST API
The ApexAgent REST API follows RESTful principles with the following conventions:

- Base URL: `/api/v1`
- Authentication: JWT tokens in Authorization header
- Response format: JSON
- Error format: `{ "error": { "code": "ERROR_CODE", "message": "Human readable message" } }`

**Key Endpoints:**
- `/api/v1/users` - User management
- `/api/v1/events` - Event management
- `/api/v1/plugins` - Plugin management

### Internal API
The internal API consists of the core services and their interfaces:

- `EventManager` - Event subscription and emission
- `PluginManager` - Plugin lifecycle management
- `ErrorRecoveryManager` - Error recovery strategies

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation, with dependencies mocked.

**Key Tools:**
- Jest for test running and assertions
- Mock objects for isolating components

### Integration Testing
Integration tests verify that components work together correctly.

**Key Areas:**
- Event system integration
- Plugin system integration
- API endpoint integration

### End-to-End Testing
E2E tests verify the system works correctly from a user perspective.

**Key Tools:**
- Playwright for browser automation
- Supertest for API testing

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use ES6+ features
- Prefer const over let, avoid var
- Use async/await for asynchronous code
- Document all public APIs with JSDoc comments

### Code Organization
- One class per file
- Group related functionality in directories
- Use index.js files to expose public API

### Naming Conventions
- CamelCase for variables and functions
- PascalCase for classes and interfaces
- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

### Error Handling
- Use custom error classes
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Include context in errors
- Handle all promise rejections

### Testing
- Write tests for all new code
- Maintain high test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

### Documentation
- Document all public APIs
- Keep documentation up-to-date
- Include examples in documentation
- Document design decisions and trade-offs
