# Vector Database Enhancement Architecture Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the architectural plan for enhancing the Aideon AI Lite vector database integration with additional backends (Milvus and Chroma) and hybrid search capabilities. The plan builds upon the existing FAISS adapter implementation while ensuring consistent interfaces, multi-tenant isolation, and enterprise-level performance.

## 1. Additional Backend Support

### 1.1 Common Adapter Interface
The existing `VectorDatabaseAdapter` abstract base class will remain the foundation for all adapters. All new adapters will implement this interface to ensure consistency across backends.

### 1.2 Milvus Adapter

#### Architecture
- **Connection Management**: Support for both standalone and cluster Milvus deployments
- **Collection Handling**: Mapping between Aideon collections and Milvus collections
- **Schema Management**: Dynamic schema creation with support for hybrid fields
- **Index Management**: Support for multiple index types (IVF_FLAT, HNSW, etc.)
- **Query Processing**: Translation between Aideon queries and Milvus queries
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Tenant-specific collection prefixing and access control

#### Key Components
- `MilvusAdapter`: Main adapter implementation
- `MilvusConnectionManager`: Handles connection pooling and failover
- `MilvusSchemaManager`: Manages collection schemas and field mappings
- `MilvusQueryBuilder`: Translates queries to Milvus format

### 1.3 Chroma Adapter

#### Architecture
- **Connection Management**: Support for both in-memory and persistent Chroma deployments
- **Collection Handling**: Mapping between Aideon collections and Chroma collections
- **Embedding Management**: Integration with Chroma's embedding functions
- **Query Processing**: Translation between Aideon queries and Chroma queries
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Tenant-specific collection prefixing and access control

#### Key Components
- `ChromaAdapter`: Main adapter implementation
- `ChromaConnectionManager`: Handles connection management
- `ChromaEmbeddingIntegration`: Integrates with Chroma's embedding functions
- `ChromaQueryBuilder`: Translates queries to Chroma format

## 2. Hybrid Search Functionality

### 2.1 Architecture
- **Hybrid Query Model**: Extended query model supporting both vector similarity and keyword/metadata filtering
- **Query Planner**: Intelligent planning of hybrid queries for optimal performance
- **Scoring Fusion**: Methods for combining vector similarity scores with keyword relevance scores
- **Adapter Support**: Backend-specific implementations of hybrid search

### 2.2 Key Components
- `HybridQuery`: Represents a combined vector and keyword query
- `HybridQueryPlanner`: Plans execution of hybrid queries
- `ScoreFusion`: Algorithms for combining different relevance scores
- `KeywordIndexManager`: Manages keyword indices for text search

### 2.3 Backend-Specific Implementations
- **FAISS + Keyword Index**: Combine FAISS vector search with an inverted index for keywords
- **Milvus Native Hybrid**: Leverage Milvus's built-in hybrid search capabilities
- **Chroma Hybrid**: Utilize Chroma's metadata filtering with vector search

## 3. Vector Database Sharding

### 3.1 Architecture
- **Sharding Strategy**: Support for hash-based and range-based sharding
- **Shard Manager**: Coordination of operations across shards
- **Query Distribution**: Intelligent distribution of queries across shards
- **Result Aggregation**: Combining results from multiple shards

### 3.2 Key Components
- `ShardManager`: Manages shard creation, distribution, and balancing
- `ShardRouter`: Routes operations to appropriate shards
- `QueryDistributor`: Distributes queries across shards
- `ResultAggregator`: Combines and ranks results from multiple shards

## 4. Cross-Tenant Access Controls

### 4.1 Architecture
- **Enhanced Tenant Middleware**: Improved tenant validation and authorization
- **Access Control Policies**: Fine-grained policies for cross-tenant access
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all cross-tenant operations
- **Tenant Isolation Verification**: Automated testing of tenant boundaries

### 4.2 Key Components
- `EnhancedTenantMiddleware`: Improved tenant middleware implementation
- `AccessControlPolicyManager`: Manages access control policies
- `CrossTenantAuditLogger`: Logs all cross-tenant operations
- `TenantIsolationVerifier`: Verifies tenant isolation boundaries

## 5. Error Recovery Mechanisms

### 5.1 Architecture
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures during outages
- **Retry Strategies**: Intelligent retry with exponential backoff
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when components fail
- **Health Monitoring**: Proactive monitoring of system health

### 5.2 Key Components
- `CircuitBreaker`: Implements circuit breaker pattern
- `RetryManager`: Manages retry strategies
- `FallbackProvider`: Provides fallback mechanisms
- `HealthMonitor`: Monitors system health

## 6. Integration Points

### 6.1 Factory Pattern Enhancement
The existing `VectorFactory` will be enhanced to support all new adapters and features:
- Dynamic adapter selection based on configuration
- Support for hybrid search configuration
- Sharding configuration and management
- Enhanced error handling and recovery

### 6.2 Configuration Management
A new configuration management system will be implemented:
- Environment-specific configurations
- Dynamic configuration updates
