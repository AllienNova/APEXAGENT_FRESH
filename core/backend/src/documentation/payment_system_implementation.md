# Aideon AI Lite Payment System Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the payment, subscription, and credit management system for Aideon AI Lite. The system has been designed to support the four-tier pricing model (Basic, Pro, Expert, and Enterprise) with flexible API key management and credit-based usage tracking.

## System Components

The payment system consists of three core modules:

1. **PaymentSystem**: Handles core payment processing, subscription creation, and credit allocation
2. **SubscriptionManager**: Manages user subscriptions, tier-specific features, and credit usage
3. **ApiKeyManager**: Securely stores, validates, and manages user-provided API keys

## Pricing Model Implementation

The system implements the four-tier pricing structure as follows:

### Basic Tier
- $24.99/month with API provided
- $19.99/month with user's own API
- 2,000 initial credits
- Up to 2 standard LLMs
- Document creation & editing capabilities

### Pro Tier
- $89.99/month with API provided
- $49.99/month with user's own API
- 5,000 initial credits
- 3 standard LLMs
- 2 advanced LLMs (High reasoning)
- Document creation & editing capabilities

### Expert Tier
- $149.99/month with API provided
- $99.99/month with user's own API
- 15,000 initial credits
- Unlimited standard LLMs
- Unlimited advanced LLMs
- Priority support
- Advanced document workflows

### Enterprise Tier
- Custom pricing
- Custom credit allocation
- Unlimited LLMs and features
- Dedicated account manager
- Custom integrations
- Team or per-computer pricing options

## Credit System Implementation

The credit system has been implemented with the following features:

1. **Initial Credit Allocation**: Each tier receives a predefined number of initial credits
2. **Credit Consumption**: Credits are consumed based on operation type:
   - Standard LLM operations: 1 credit
   - Advanced LLM operations: 5 credits
   - Image generation: 10 credits
   - Audio processing: 3 credits
   - Video processing: 15 credits
3. **API Key Integration**: When users provide their own API keys, operations using those keys do not consume credits
4. **Credit Purchase**: Users can purchase additional credits with volume discounts:
   - <10,000 credits: $0.01 per credit
   - 10,000-50,000 credits: $0.009 per credit
   - 50,000-100,000 credits: $0.007 per credit
   - 100,000+ credits: $0.005 per credit

## API Key Management

The system includes secure API key management with the following features:

1. **Supported Providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, Cohere, Stability, and HuggingFace
2. **Secure Storage**: API keys are encrypted before storage using AES-256-CBC
3. **Validation**: Provider-specific validation rules ensure API keys meet format requirements
4. **Testing**: API keys can be tested for validity before being stored

## Integration Points

The payment system integrates with other Aideon AI Lite components through:

1. **User Management**: Links subscriptions to user accounts
2. **Feature Access Control**: Restricts access to features based on subscription tier
3. **Model Selection**: Limits available AI models based on subscription tier
4. **Credit Tracking**: Monitors and reports on credit usage

## Testing Results

The payment system has been thoroughly tested with a comprehensive test suite covering:

1. **Subscription Management**: Creating, updating, and canceling subscriptions
2. **Credit Operations**: Allocating, consuming, and purchasing credits
3. **API Key Handling**: Storing, retrieving, and validating API keys
4. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflows combining all components

Test results indicate that the core functionality is working as expected, with a minor issue in the API key validation logic that should be addressed before production deployment.

## Recommendations for Production Deployment

1. **Payment Processor Integration**: Implement actual integrations with Stripe and PayPal
2. **Database Integration**: Replace in-memory storage with secure database operations
3. **Enhanced Encryption**: Implement proper key management for API key encryption
4. **Logging and Monitoring**: Add comprehensive logging for payment operations
5. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling with retry mechanisms
6. **Admin Interface**: Develop an admin interface for subscription and payment management
7. **Reporting**: Implement detailed reporting on subscription and credit usage

## Conclusion

The payment system implementation provides a solid foundation for monetizing Aideon AI Lite with a flexible, tier-based subscription model. The system supports the required pricing structure, credit management, and API key handling, while providing a clear path for production deployment.
