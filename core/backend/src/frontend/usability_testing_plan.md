  - Jest for unit tests
  - React Testing Library for component tests

### 2. Manual Testing

- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing with:
  - NVDA on Windows
  - VoiceOver on macOS
- Color contrast verification
- Responsive design testing across different viewport sizes

### 3. User Testing

- Recruit 5-7 participants with varying technical expertise
- Include participants with disabilities when possible
- Use think-aloud protocol during testing sessions
- Record sessions for later analysis
- Collect both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback
