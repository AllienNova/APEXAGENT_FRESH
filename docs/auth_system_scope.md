# Authentication and Authorization System: Scope and Objectives

## Overview

The Authentication and Authorization System will provide a comprehensive security framework for the ApexAgent platform, enabling secure user management, role-based access control, and integration with enterprise identity providers. This system will serve as the foundation for other security features such as subscription management and data protection.

## Objectives

1. **Create a robust user identity management system** that securely handles user authentication across multiple methods
2. **Implement fine-grained access control** through role-based and attribute-based permissions
3. **Enable enterprise integration** through SSO and identity provider connections
4. **Provide plugin security** through permission management and isolation
5. **Support advanced security features** such as biometric authentication and geo-restrictions
6. **Ensure compliance** with security standards and regulations
