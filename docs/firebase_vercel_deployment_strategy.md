### Current Deployment Challenges

The existing system faces several deployment challenges that Firebase and Vercel can address:

**Cost Optimization:** Traditional cloud deployments can be expensive, especially for startups and small businesses. The current Docker-based deployment requires dedicated server resources that may be underutilized during low-traffic periods.

**Scalability Concerns:** The current architecture requires manual scaling and load balancing configuration, which can be complex and error-prone during traffic spikes.

**Maintenance Overhead:** Managing server infrastructure, security updates, and monitoring requires significant DevOps expertise and ongoing maintenance effort.

**Global Distribution:** Achieving low-latency global access requires complex CDN configuration and multi-region deployments that are costly to implement and maintain.

```

**Firebase Functions Architecture:**
```javascript
// functions/src/index.js
const functions = require('firebase-functions');
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');

admin.initializeApp();

const app = express();
app.use(cors({ origin: true }));

// Import route modules
const authRoutes = require('./auth/routes');
const apiRoutes = require('./api/routes');
const securityRoutes = require('./security/routes');

// Configure routes
app.use('/auth', authRoutes);
app.use('/api', apiRoutes);
app.use('/security', securityRoutes);

// Export the main function
exports.api = functions.https.onRequest(app);
```

    }
    
    // Projects with role-based access
    match /projects/{projectId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        resource.data.members[request.auth.uid] in ['owner', 'admin', 'member'];
    }
    
    // Security logs - admin only
    match /security_logs/{logId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null &&

      ? 'https://aideon-backend.web.app/api'
      : 'http://localhost:5001/aideon-project/us-central1/api';
  }

  async authenticatedRequest(endpoint, options = {}) {
    const token = await this.getAuthToken();
    return fetch(`${this.baseURL}${endpoint}`, {
      ...options,
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        ...options.headers
      }
    });
  }

  async getAuthToken() {
    const user = firebase.auth().currentUser;
    return user ? await user.getIdToken() : null;
  }
}
```
