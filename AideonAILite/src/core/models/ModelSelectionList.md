## Integration Strategy

The integration strategy for these models will follow a hybrid approach:

1. **Primary Models**: Each modality will have one primary proprietary model and one primary open-source model configured for immediate use.

2. **Fallback Chain**: Models will be arranged in a fallback chain, allowing the system to gracefully degrade to alternative models if the primary model is unavailable or unsuitable.

3. **Dynamic Selection**: The system will dynamically select the most appropriate model based on:
   - Task requirements
   - Available computational resources
   - User preferences and API key availability
   - Licensing constraints

4. **Hybrid Processing**: Leverage local processing for open-source models when appropriate, falling back to cloud APIs for proprietary models or when local resources are insufficient.

5. **Caching and Optimization**: Implement intelligent caching and resource optimization to minimize latency and costs.

This comprehensive selection ensures Aideon AI Lite will have access to the best models across all modalities, maximizing its capabilities while maintaining flexibility and resilience.
