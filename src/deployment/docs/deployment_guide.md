# ApexAgent Cloud Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for deploying ApexAgent to various cloud environments. The deployment system supports AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Azure, with both containerized and serverless options.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed locally for building and testing containers
- Access to at least one cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
- Terraform 1.0.0 or higher
- kubectl command-line tool
- Cloud provider CLI tools (aws-cli, gcloud, az)

## Quick Start

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/apexagent.git
   cd apexagent
   ```

2. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   cd src/deployment/docker
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Access the application at http://localhost:8000

### Cloud Deployment

#### AWS Deployment

1. Configure AWS credentials:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

2. Deploy using CloudFormation:
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation deploy \
     --template-file src/deployment/aws/cloudformation-ecs.yaml \
     --stack-name apexagent-production \
     --parameter-overrides \
       Environment=production \
       ContainerImage=your-registry/apexagent:latest \
       DomainName=apexagent.example.com
   ```

#### Google Cloud Deployment

1. Configure GCP credentials:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   gcloud config set project your-project-id
   ```

2. Create GKE cluster:
   ```bash
   gcloud container clusters create apexagent \
     --zone us-central1-a \
     --num-nodes 3
   ```

3. Deploy to GKE:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f src/deployment/gcp/gke-deployment.yaml
   ```

#### Azure Deployment

1. Configure Azure credentials:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```

2. Deploy using Terraform:
   ```bash
   cd src/deployment/azure
   terraform init
   terraform apply -var="environment=production"
   ```

## Infrastructure as Code

For more advanced deployments, use the Terraform configuration:

```bash
cd src/deployment/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply -var="environment=production"
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The repository includes GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and deployment:

- Push to `develop` branch: Deploys to development environment
- Push to `main` branch: Deploys to staging environment
- Manual workflow dispatch: Can deploy to any environment

## Monitoring and Observability

The deployment includes:

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Jaeger for distributed tracing

Access Grafana at: https://grafana.your-domain.com

## Disaster Recovery

Backup and recovery procedures are included for all environments:

- Database backups are automated daily
- Cross-region replication is enabled for production
- Recovery procedures are documented in the disaster recovery plan

## Security

The deployment follows security best practices:

- All communications encrypted in transit
- Secrets managed through cloud provider secret stores
- Network security with least privilege access
- Regular security scanning integrated into CI/CD

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Deployment Failures**
   - Check CloudWatch/StackDriver logs
   - Verify IAM permissions
   - Ensure resource quotas are sufficient

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Review Grafana dashboards
   - Check resource utilization
   - Verify autoscaling is functioning

3. **Connectivity Problems**
   - Verify security group/firewall rules
   - Check DNS configuration
   - Ensure health checks are passing
