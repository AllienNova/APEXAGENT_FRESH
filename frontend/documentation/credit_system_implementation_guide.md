## Partial API Key Management Implementation

### Smart Credit Consumption Logic

```python
def calculate_credit_consumption(user_api_keys, operation_type, model_requested):
    """
    Calculate credit consumption based on user's available API keys
    """
    if has_user_api_key(user_api_keys, model_requested):
        # User has their own API key for this model
        return 0  # No credits consumed
    else:
        # Use system API key and consume credits
        return get_credit_cost(operation_type, model_requested)

def route_operation(user_api_keys, operation_type, quality_preference):
    """
    Smart routing to minimize credit consumption while maintaining quality
    """
    available_models = get_available_models(user_api_keys, operation_type)
    
    if available_models:
        # Prioritize models where user has API keys
        return select_best_user_model(available_models, quality_preference)
    else:
        # Use system models and consume credits
        return select_system_model(operation_type, quality_preference)
```

### User Dashboard Credit Tracking

The user dashboard will display:

1. **Credit Balance**: Current remaining credits
2. **Monthly Allocation**: Total credits for current billing period
3. **Usage Breakdown**:
   - Operations using user API keys (0 credits)
   - Operations using system API keys (credit cost shown)
4. **Service Status**: Which services use user vs. system API keys
5. **Projected Usage**: Estimated credits needed for current usage patterns

### API Key Status Indicators

| Service | User Key Status | Credit Impact |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| OpenAI | ✅ Provided | Text operations: 0 credits |
| Anthropic | ❌ Not provided | Text operations: 10-15 credits per 1K tokens |
| Midjourney | ✅ Provided | Image operations: 0 credits |
| Runway | ❌ Not provided | Video operations: 80-180 credits per 5-sec |

## Enterprise Implementation Considerations

### Multi-Tenant Credit Management

For enterprise deployments, the system supports:

1. **Centralized Credit Pool**: IT department manages credits for all users
2. **Department Allocation**: Credits allocated by department or team
3. **Individual Limits**: Per-user credit limits within enterprise allocation
4. **Cost Center Tracking**: Usage tracking by department for billing

### Enterprise API Key Policies

Three configurable policies for enterprise deployments:

1. **IT Controlled**: All API keys managed by IT department
   - Maximum security and cost control
   - Centralized billing and usage tracking
   - No user-provided keys allowed

2. **Hybrid Control**: IT provides core services, users add supplemental
   - IT provides expensive services (GPT-4, video generation)
   - Users can add personal keys for additional services
   - Balanced security and flexibility

3. **User Controlled**: Users manage their own API keys
   - Maximum flexibility for users
   - IT provides fallback for missing services
   - Individual cost optimization

## Credit Purchase and Management

### Additional Credit Purchases

Users can purchase additional credits at any time:

- **Credit Packages**: 1,000 credits ($10), 5,000 credits ($45), 10,000 credits ($85)
- **Bulk Discounts**: 5% off for 10,000+ credits, 10% off for 25,000+ credits
- **Auto-refill**: Automatic credit purchase when balance drops below threshold
- **Rollover Policy**: Unused credits roll over for up to 3 months

### Credit Expiration Policy

- **Monthly Allocation**: Expires at end of billing cycle
- **Purchased Credits**: 12-month expiration from purchase date
- **Enterprise Credits**: Custom expiration based on contract terms
- **Grace Period**: 30-day grace period for expired credits

- Add comprehensive audit logging

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Credit Utilization**: Average credits used per user per month
2. **API Key Adoption**: Percentage of users providing their own keys
3. **Cost Optimization**: Savings achieved through smart routing
4. **Revenue Impact**: Additional credit purchases and tier upgrades

### Dashboard Analytics

- **Real-time Usage**: Current credit consumption across all users
- **Trend Analysis**: Usage patterns and seasonal variations
- **Cost Analysis**: Actual API costs vs. credit revenue
- **User Behavior**: Credit purchase patterns and tier migration

## Security and Compliance

### Credit System Security

- **Fraud Prevention**: Rate limiting and anomaly detection
- **Audit Logging**: Complete transaction history for all credit operations
- **Data Encryption**: All credit and usage data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access to credit management functions

### Compliance Considerations

- **Financial Regulations**: Compliance with payment processing regulations
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR/CCPA compliance for usage data
- **Audit Requirements**: SOC2 compliance for credit system operations
- **Enterprise Compliance**: Custom compliance requirements for enterprise clients
