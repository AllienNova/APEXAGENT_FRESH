## Plugin Management

The plugin interface allows users to discover, activate, and configure extensions to enhance ApexAgent's capabilities, with clear indication of system access requirements.

### Components:
- **Plugin Cards**: Visual representation of available plugins with toggle activation
- **Permission Requirements**: Clear display of what system access each plugin needs
- **Local Storage Usage**: Indication of disk space used by each plugin
- **Configuration Panels**: Customization options for active plugins
- **Plugin Directory**: Local directory where plugin files are stored

### Key Features:
- Transparent display of plugin system access requirements
- Local storage and installation of all plugin components
- Clear permission management for each plugin
- Ability to limit plugin access to specific directories
- Offline availability of installed plugins

## Dr. TARDIS Troubleshooting Interface

The Dr. TARDIS interface provides advanced diagnostic and troubleshooting tools to identify and resolve system-level issues.

### Components:
- **System Diagnostic Tools**: Deep analysis of local environment and configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Inspection and modification of system environment

- **Repair Tools**: Utilities to fix common system-level issues

### Key Features:
- Deep integration with local system for thorough diagnostics
- Direct access to system configuration and environment
- Local log storage and analysis
- Repair capabilities for common system issues
- Transparent display of all system modifications

## File Operations Interface

A dedicated interface for managing files and directories with full transparency.

### Components:
- **File Browser**: Familiar explorer-like interface to local file system
- **Operation Log**: Record of all file operations performed by ApexAgent
- **Batch Operations**: Tools for managing multiple files simultaneously
- **Preview Panel**: Quick view of file contents without opening
- **Permission Indicator**: Clear display of access rights to different locations

### Key Features:
- Direct integration with the local file system
- Familiar navigation patterns matching the OS file explorer
- Transparent logging of all file operations
- Clear permission indicators for different directories
- Ability to limit agent access to specific locations

## Design System Elements

### Typography
- Sans-serif fonts for readability
- Clear hierarchy with 3-4 text sizes
- Consistent font weights for emphasis

### Color Palette
- Primary brand color with complementary accents
- Neutral background colors (light and dark modes)
- Semantic colors for status indicators (success, warning, error)
- Accessible contrast ratios throughout

### Iconography
- Consistent icon set for file types matching OS conventions
- Clear visual distinction between local and remote resources
- Status indicators for system operations
- Permission-related icons for quick recognition

### Interaction Patterns
- Consistent hover and focus states
- Loading indicators for system operations
- Animated transitions between states
- Clear feedback for all user actions
- Permission request dialogs following OS conventions

## Accessibility Considerations
- High contrast text and interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management for interactive elements
- Alternative text for visual elements

## Responsive Design
- Optimized for desktop environments where the application runs
- Support for different screen resolutions and multi-monitor setups
- Detachable panels for custom workspace arrangements
- Consistent experience across Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Next Steps
These revised wireframes and screen designs provide the foundation for implementing the ApexAgent frontend as a true desktop application with deep system integration. Upon approval, development will proceed with:

1. Implementation of core UI framework and base components
2. Development of system integration features and local file management
3. Implementation of permission management and activity monitoring
4. Usability testing across different operating systems
5. Final delivery with comprehensive documentation
